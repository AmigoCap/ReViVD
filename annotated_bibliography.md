# ReViVD Annotated Bibliography

## Context

FiberClay [1] lets users to display and interact with 3D trajectories through virtual reality. This is the first visualization tool that provides selections of 3D trajectories "with a bi-manual, iterative, brushing technique and continuous navigation between visual configurations".
The authors of this system took into account trajectories visualization and virtual reality considerations to develop an appropriate visualization tool.
Fiberclay was used to explore data air traffic, interactions with data let the user identifying and emphasizing anamolies and unusual trajectories in a better way than 2D exploration did. The immersive exploration of a brain scan allowed the authors to develop different bundling algorithms to simplify the dataset display.
The paper also alludes to the pros and cons of 2D vs 3D exploration systems.

## Books on Unity
Reference [5] provides an introduction to Unity through some little game projects. Optimization of the game and the scenes, collision management, interaction with the virtual environment and user interface are some points which are discussed in this reference.

In reference [6], A. Cardinale provides aspects of the history of VR technology and equipment. He uses the Google SDK to introduce the reader to a VR project with Unity. Some explanations and good practices to follow are explained for user interface and use of a controller. It also recalls the 5 fundamental rules of ergonomics and immersion to follow in a VR project to avoid motion sickness and enhance the immersive experience:

**Ergonomics rules**
1. Use of a reticle
2. Depth and eye fatigue
3. Use of a constant speed
4. Put markers on the ground
5. Head tracking

**Immersion rules**
1. Lead with light
2. Use decor and scale
3. Create a sound universe
4. Interact with look
5. Do not disregard the visual aspect

## Critics of VR Data Visualization
The blog spot [7] tackles the application of Virtual Reality in data visualization. According to the author, there is no advantage of using VR visualization instead of 2D tools to display abstract data. Moreover, it could be less effective or event counterproductive.

## 3D Visualization of the World Wide Web
The paper [11] reviews several approaches to visualize the Web, its structure, the searches on the Web, the users and the evolution of a website.

## Study of the impact of map-based visualizations on recall accuracy
The results presented in reference [12] show that users recall data shown with node-link-group diagrams better than data shown with node-link diagrams.
Users also spent more time exploring NLG diagrams than NL diagrams.

## Comparison of 3 visualization environments
Reference [16] presents a comparison of several visualization environments used for 3D exploration:
* Augmented-reality head-mounted headset
* Handheld tablet
* Desktop setup
The results of this paper show that each environment is efficient for some specific tasks and that overall the desktop setup is the fastest and more precise.

## Immersive graph visualization with virtual reality
Reference [19] creates an immersive graph visualization with virtual reality. This paper explores the point of view immersed in a graph and how to deform the layout to better explore it. 
Main contributions of this work are:
* "3 graph layout algorithms for the surface of a sphere"
* "A spherical edge routing and bundling approach, to be viewed from the inside"
* "An application of line rendering techniques from scientific visualizations to the field of graph visualization"
* "A VR interaction paradigm for graph visualization"
