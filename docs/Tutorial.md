All participants followed the following training procedure:

*Some explanations are given: you will use VR to visualize data trajectories and first we will introduce you the ReViVD tool and its funcionalities through a tutorial. We explain the controllers and the buttons: Joystick, Pad, Trigger and Grip and then the participant puts the headset.
*Tutorial is launched and we ask the participant to not touch the buttons of the controllers before we ask them to do so, as we will introduce the funcionalities step by step:

**Movement with joysticks.
**Now the Selection process: you will be able to interact with data through 3D shapes. Each controller plays a particular role: the right one is for selection, and the left one is for operations on the selections. Let us focus on the right controller and how to select trajectories.

**You have a green sphere in front of you attached to your right hand, you can select with right trigger if the shape collides with a trajectory.
**Persistent selector: you can detach the selector from your hand to leave it in the scene and then select with this persistent selector

**Invert mode: you can erase, retrieve trajectories from the selection, retrieve persistent selectors and change your speed. How to change the speed.
**How to change of color and so of selector with the right touchpad.
**You are now able to select things with different selectors and colors, you may want to make operations with these selections and persistent selectors. Let us now focus on the left controller which controls the operations.
        \item How to add and delete colors in the operations. How to change the operation: AND or OR. A green OR blue selection is made with the participant to use these funcionalities.

**Then we explain RESET and how to erase the selection.

*At the end of the tutorial, we ask the participant to complete a simple task: select and display only the flights between Paris and Lyon.




We recorded participants from outside, but also a screencast from their pov.
