## Context - FiberClay

FiberClay [1] also lets users display and interact with 3D trajectories through virtual reality. This is the first visualization tool that provides selections of 3D trajectories "with a bi-manual, iterative, brushing technique and continuous navigation between visual configurations". 
The authors of this system took into account trajectories visualization and virtual reality considerations to develop an appropriate visualization tool. Fiberclay was used to explore data air traffic. Interactions with data let the user identify anamolies and unusual trajectories in a better way than 2D exploration did.

The project also explores the implementation of bundling algorithms to simplify the dataset. Finally, the paper alludes to the pros and cons of 2D vs 3D exploration systems.

## Similar project of 3D data exploration
ImAxes [2] is a  multidimensional data visualization system that allows the user to build 2D and 3D visualizations with embodied interaction in VR. In ImAxes, a user can make multidimensional queries by connecting and linking visualizations, but does not provide direct manipulations to select data.

## Books on Unity
Reference [5] provides an introduction to Unity through some little game projects. Optimization of the game and the scenes, collision management, interaction with the virtual environment and user interface are some points which are discussed in this reference.

In his book on VR development with Unity [6], A. Cardinale provides aspects of the history of VR technology and equipment. He uses the Google SDK to introduce the reader to a VR project with Unity. 
Some explanations and good practices to follow are explained regarding user interface and use of controllers. It also recalls the 5 fundamental rules of ergonomics and immersion to follow in a VR project to avoid motion sickness and enhance the immersive experience:

**Ergonomics rules**
1. Use a reticle in the center of the screen
2. Avoid eye fatigue through proper 3D rendering
3. Use a constant movement speed
4. Put markers on the ground
5. Implement proper head tracking

**Immersion rules**
1. Lead the user with light
2. Use ackground and scale
3. Create a sound universe
4. Interact through looking at objects
5. Do not disregard visual aspects

## Critics of VR Data Visualization
S. Few's blog [7] tackles the application of Virtual Reality in data visualization. According to him, there is no advantage of using VR visualization instead of 2D tools to display abstract data. Moreover, it could even be counterproductive for data analysis.

## Visualization Toolkit
With IATK [8], it is possible to create data visualizations and interact with data in V/AR through extensive use of projections on 2D planes.

## Study of the impact of map-based visualizations on recall accuracy
The results presented in reference [12] show that users recall data shown with node-link-group diagrams better than data shown with node-link diagrams.
Users also spent more time exploring NLG diagrams than NL diagrams.

## Comparison of 3 visualization environments
B. Bach's "The Hologram in My Hand" [16] presents a comparison of several visualization environments used for 3D exploration:
* Augmented-reality head-mounted headset
* Handheld tablet
* Desktop setup

The results of this paper show that each environment is efficient for specific tasks, but that overall, a desktop setup stays faster and more precise for data analysis.
